<h1> Graph algorithms </h1>
Project contains two algorithms for representation graph in computer. First algorithm use an adjacency matrix and second use an adjacenty list.

<h3> Adjacenty matrix </h3>
Specifically, the adjacency matrix of a finite graph G on n vertices is the n Ã— n matrix where the non-diagonal entry aij is the number of edges from vertex i to vertex j, and the diagonal entry aii, depending on the convention, is either once or twice the number of edges (loops) from vertex i to itself. Undirected graphs often use the latter convention of counting loops twice, whereas directed graphs typically use the former convention. There exists a unique adjacency matrix for each isomorphism class of graphs (up to permuting rows and columns), and it is not the adjacency matrix of any other isomorphism class of graphs. In the special case of a finite simple graph, the adjacency matrix is a (0,1)-matrix with zeros on its diagonal. If the graph is undirected, the adjacency matrix is symmetric.

<h3> Adjacenty list </h3>
In graph theory and computer science, an adjacency list representation of a graph is a collection of unordered lists, one for each vertex in the graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of its vertex.
